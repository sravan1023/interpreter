# Interpreter Module

## Overview

The Interpreter module provides script execution and shell capabilities for the Xinu operating system. It consists of a script interpreter for executing code and an interactive command shell for user interaction.

## Components

### Script Interpreter
**Files:** `script_interpreter.c`, `interpreter.h`

Executes scripts and bytecode generated by the compiler module. Features include:

- Variable management with type support
- Function definitions and calls
- Control flow execution (if, while, for)
- Expression evaluation
- Script context management
- Memory-safe execution environment

### Shell
**Files:** `shell.c`, `shell.h`

An interactive command-line interface for the Xinu operating system. Provides:

- Command parsing and execution
- Built-in commands
- Command history
- Aliases
- I/O redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`)
- Pipes (`|`)
- Background processes (`&`)
- Conditional execution (`&&`, `||`)

## Key Features

- **Interactive Mode**: Command-line shell with prompt
- **Script Execution**: Run script files
- **Variable Support**: Integer, string, and array variables
- **Function Support**: User-defined functions
- **Control Structures**: if/else, while, for loops
- **Expression Evaluation**: Arithmetic and logical operations
- **Command Pipeline**: Chain commands with pipes
- **Job Control**: Background process execution


## Configuration

- **Maximum Command Line Length**: 256 characters
- **Maximum Arguments**: 32
- **Command History Size**: 50 entries
- **Maximum Aliases**: 32

## Built-in Commands

The shell includes various built-in commands for system interaction, process management, and utility operations.

## Integration

Works with the compiler module to execute compiled bytecode and provides a user interface for interacting with the Xinu operating system.
